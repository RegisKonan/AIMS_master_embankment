## Title: Application of Darcy's law in a 2D porous embankment.

### Abstract: 

Given the population growth expected in the coming years and the rapid rate at which we are consuming water resources, the UN predicts that by 2025, 1.8 billion people will be living in countries or regions affected by total water scarcity and about 5 billion in regions where it will be difficult to meet all freshwater needs, the future remains uncertain. The objective of this work is to apply Darcy’s law, which is the most fundamental law for flows in porous media, to a porous
embankment in order to find out how much water will be able to pass through the embankment to be conserved and to avoid the risk of flooding. In the first part, we present a general overview o find out what work has already been done on a dam or in a porous medium. The second part consists of a general overview of porous media. In this part, Darcy’s law defines as well as its parameters and the properties that characterize the porous medium. In the last part, we prove and calculate the flow of water in a horizontal or non-horizontal porous embankment. We explore the application to real-world situations
